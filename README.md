# GraphThoery-Isomorphism

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that explores the concept of graph isomorphism. The notebook explains what a graph is, what isomorphism means, and how it applies to graphs. It also demonstrates how to determine if two graphs are isomorphic using Python and the NetworkX library.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NetworkX library
- Matplotlib library
- Numpy Library
- Itertools Library


## Installation
You can install the required libraries by running the following command:
```python 
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import itertools as it
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


## Usage
To use this project, Click into Graph_Isomorphism.ipynb as github will display the notebook or clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file Graph_Isomorphism.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

## Contents
Graph_Isomorphism.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file that explains and demonstrates graph isomorphism using Python and NetworkX library.
